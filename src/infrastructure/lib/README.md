# Library

All of our custom utilities logic will live here. We do not encourage the use of third-party libraries unless it is
 absolutely necessary. 
 
 ## Let's Hack Together
 
 When are set to come up with a custom library, create a directory inside of the `/lib` directory. All directories
  should have a `readme.md` file that describes the intent and usage examples of the library you write.
  
```ignore
  --- lib
    --- customHooks
      --- README.md
      --- useMyHook.jsx
```
